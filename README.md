**📝 Sentiment Analysis with NLP**
A Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that classifies text into positive or negative sentiment using machine learning models.

📁 Dataset
Used a labeled dataset of reviews (e.g., movie reviews, tweets).
Each text entry includes a corresponding sentiment label (positive, negative).

🔧 Preprocessing
Converted text to lowercase
Vectorized text using TF-IDF for feature extraction

🧠 Model
Implemented Logistic Regression using scikit-learn.
Trained the model on preprocessed vectorized text and tested it on unseen data.
Optionally compared with Naive Bayes or other NLP models.

📊 Evaluation
Accuracy score
Confusion matrix and heatmap
Classification report

🚀 Future Enhancements
Experiment with deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, BERT)
Add a sentiment prediction web UI
Train on multilingual datasets for broader coverage
